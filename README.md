Scatterplot Analyses:

In the Northern hemisphere plot, there is a strong negative correlation between Temperature and Latitude. The dots are densely packed and has a high r^2 value. There is a weaker positive correlation between Temperature and Latitude on the Southern hemisphere, where the dots are less densely packed and the r^2 value is smaller.

For the Northern hemisphere plot of Latitude vs Humidity, there are weak positive correlations between the two features. Both of the r^2 values are about 0.14 which is not very strong. In addition to this, there are many outliers in the low humidities which I believe would cause a weaker relationship between the two features.

Both of the r^2 values for the Northern and Southern hemisphere plots of Latitude vs Cloudiness are from 0.015 to 0.15, indicating a not very strong relationship. In addition to this, both plots have MANY outliers on the very top and the very bottom that create little clusters. Thus, although the relationship is there and is usable, it is not very strong.

The Northern hemisphere plot is reasonably well kept, with some outliers on the top of the scatterplot. The Southern hemisphere plot of Latitude and Wind Speed is more spread out. Despite this, the r^2 value for the Southern plot is about 0.08 and the Northern plot 0.02. Overall, the relationships are not very strong, even though the Northern plot for Latitude and Wind Speed looks to be pretty good.
